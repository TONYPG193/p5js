# Some fun examples

## Color
* [ColorExplorer3D](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Color/ColorExplorer3D/): Explore the RGB color space in 2D and 3D. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Color/ColorExplorer3D)

## Sound
* [Sound Visualization](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Sound/SoundVis4-ImprovedPerformance/): Processes microphone input in realtime and shows a scrolling waveform and various frequency visualizations (spectrogram, spectral graph). [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Sound/SoundVis4-ImprovedPerformance).

## Perlin Noise
* [NoiseGraph](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/PerlinNoise/NoiseGraph): Compare random to [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) in a scrolling graph. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/PerlinNoise/Noise2D).
* [Noise2D](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/PerlinNoise/Noise2D/): Explore [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) in 2D. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/PerlinNoise/NoiseGraph).

## Vectors
* [Angle Explorer](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Vectors/AngleExplorer/): Shows how to use vectors to calculate angles
* [Angle Playground](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Vectors/AnglePlayground/): Draw two arrows and calculate angle between them
* [Bouncing balls and line segments](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Vectors/BouncingBallsAndLineSegmentsImproved/): Demonstrates how to use vectors to calculate vectors and reflecting collisions

## Computer Vision
* [Hand pose demo](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/ml5js/HandPose/HandPoseDemo/): demonstration of the [ml5js](https://ml5js.org/) [handpose library](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/handpose)
* [Hand wave recognizer](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/ml5js/HandPose/HandWaveDetector/): wave your hand at the camera
* [Elmo generator](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/ml5js/PoseNet/ElmoGeneratorMultiperson/): turn you and your friends into Elmo in realtime! Uses the [ml5js PoseNet implementation](https://learn.ml5js.org/#/reference/posenet)

## Games
Many of these games were created in 2020 when I first started learning p5js.

* [Snake](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/Snake/): simple [Snake] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake) game. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/Snake).
* [Pong](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/Pong): simple [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) game. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/Pong).
* [Flappy Bird](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/FlappyBird2/): simple [Flappy Bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flappy_Bird) game with procedural backgrounds. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/FlappyBird2).
* [Cookie Monster](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/CookieMonster3/): simple 2D game starring my face and Sesame Street's cookie monster. This is my children's favorite game. Inspired by [Robotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotron:_2084). [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/CookieMonster3)
* [Simple Keyboard Game](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/SimpleKeyboardGame/): rapid prototype of a simple 2D game like [Cookie Monster](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/CookieMonster3/). [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/SimpleKeyboardGame).

### Sound as input

* [FFTGame](https://makeabilitylab.github.io/p5js/Games/FFTGame/): use different frequencies (pitches) of sound to launch a ball into the air. [Code link](https://github.com/makeabilitylab/p5js/tree/master/Games/FFTGame)
