- Can use https://www.jsdelivr.com/ to serve common files
- Nice video on how to use visual studio code with p5js: https://youtu.be/MOLp_zZ7Dqg
- Get intellisense in p5js and VS Code: https://breaksome.tech/p5js-editor-how-to-set-up-visual-studio-code/. More on this here: https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues/1339 and for `jsconfig.json` here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig
-- Alternatively, maybe use this extension instead: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode
